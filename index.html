    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Marilyn, a passionate tech enthusiast and cybersecurity professional. I’ve worked hard to transition into the tech industry after years in the nonprofit sector, bringing with me a wealth of experience in sales, business ownership, and resilience. My journey is fueled by curiosity and a love for problem-solving, especially when it comes to technology and protecting sensitive data.</p>
    <p>When I’m not working, I love stargazing, exploring everything about space, and catching up on Science Channel documentaries. I’m also a single mom to my amazing daughter, Phoenix, who keeps me inspired every day. Together, we enjoy trips to the beach and fun activities like playing Roblox.</p>

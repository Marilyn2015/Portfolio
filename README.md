    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Marilyn, a dedicated and self-motivated tech enthusiast with a strong passion for cybersecurity and problem-solving. My journey into the tech world has been a testament to resilience and adaptability. Coming from a background in the nonprofit sector and sales, I have honed my skills in leadership, strategic thinking, and effective communication. These experiences laid the foundation for my successful transition into the tech industry, where I have been focusing on mastering cybersecurity tools and methodologies to protect data and systems from modern threats.</p>

    <p>In my current role as a Computer Systems Analyst for the Department of Defense, I’ve had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technology projects, including encryption, data transfer, and secure communications for the Raptor F22. I am proficient in tools such as ICAT, PCDS, ANGEL, and MSCU, and I take great pride in my ability to handle complex decryption processes. Recently, I contributed to the creation of a Tempest package, which has been a significant milestone in my career.</p>

    <p>Beyond my professional achievements, I am a lifelong learner who actively seeks out opportunities to grow. Whether it's studying for new certifications like my CISA Plus or experimenting with honeypots in my home lab, I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and sharpen my skills. I’m particularly fascinated by the endless possibilities of space exploration and often spend my free time watching documentaries on the Science Channel and Discovery+. My daughter, Phoenix, is my greatest source of inspiration. Together, we enjoy trips to the beach, where she thrives, and engage in fun, creative activities like exploring Roblox together.</p>

    <p>My personal philosophy is rooted in the belief that challenges are opportunities for growth. I strive to bring this mindset to every project and interaction, aiming to make a meaningful impact while continuously pushing my limits. I’m excited about the future of technology and the role I can play in shaping it, one innovation at a time.</p>
